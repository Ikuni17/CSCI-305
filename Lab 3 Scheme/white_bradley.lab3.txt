Lab #3 Scheme Questions
4-9-2016

1. (3 8 9 2 4 10)
2. Recursively iterate through a list and add one to each element.
3. If statement to check for an empty list and is the base case for the recursion
4. If the list is empty return ()
5. Else add one to the first element of the list and concatenate to a new list, 
	then recursively call the function on the remainder of the list.
6. #f
7. ABORT: (unbound-variable). The call to member? requires a single quote before the element
	otherwise it gets evaluated. So, we would need (member? 'd '(...))
8. #f
9. #f
10. (sanwich ham blue eggs and cheese)
11. (blue cheese and)
12. The built in functions null?, cons, car, cdr, etc can be very powerful.
13. Using recursion for everything can be irritating, but with some practice it wasn't
	too difficult.
14. About 7 hours, most of which was relearning the Linux kernal and Guile, not actually
	writing code in Scheme, which is frustrating and not really the scope of this lab.
15. Somewhat, it was nice to learn a new paradigm of programming languages. I don't really
	see myself using Scheme again unless it is required though.
