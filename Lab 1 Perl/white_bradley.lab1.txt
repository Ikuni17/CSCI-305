16. The string and text manipulation is extremely powerful and quick.
17. Regular expressions are really complicated and hard to decipher without memorizing what each token does.
18. I found this lab frustrating, mainly having to research every little thing I needed to implement. It was
	difficult to make progress at the beginning because of the regular expressions and needing to filter
	the file before being able to proceed with the lab. I also had to learn hash tables because I'm
	taking CSCI 232 currently, which compounded the difficulty.
19. Approximately 30 hours.
20. If I ever have to process large amounts of text, I could see myself using it again.
